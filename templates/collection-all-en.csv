"Yassir","AMAZINE","(Belgium, 1975- )","Yassir_AMAZINE.jpg","Yassir Amazine attended the classes of Luc Mondry and Nicole Babilas at La Clarière.His drawings are in ball point, black, red, green or blue. He sings or hums while drawing, and speaks rarely or not at all. In fact, is he singing? Is he drawing? Or is he running away? He never looks for a model for his drawings. Some subjects are repeated: sun, house and mosque, aeroplane, car, guitar. An apparent disorder but the paper is entirely covered (usually both sides), it all makes sense. Yassir Amazine has finished his drawing, and has stopped singing. The drawing begins its own life, it exists in its own right, nourished by the artist."
"Inès","ANDOUCHE","(Belgium, 1958-)","Ines_ANDOUCHE.JPG","For the ten years in her life she lived an itinerant life with her parents in Africa, principally in the Congo. In 1961 Inès return in Europe and attended several different institutions in Switzerland and then in France, where she joined Hemptinne Centre’s creative studio. She draws with great intensity. With strong gestures she tackles pictures in magazines, taking them over and giving them a new life. This apparently simple mental transfer dignifies the insignificant, the ordinary or even the ignored. Her univers probably conveys some memories of the culture of her childhood, today conducted by a strong artistic personality."
"Seyni","AWA CAMARA","(Senegal, 1939-)","Seyni_CAMARA.jpg","Seyni Awa has always contested ancestral prohibitions. She has displayed her eccentricity, her fantasies and the “evil” spirits inside her.  She makes fun of the rules and gives full rein to all her fantasies. In the yard in front of the house, she models her clay figures, half-women, half-monsters and produces other little laughing monsters. In a hole, the most rudimentary kiln imaginable, also in front of the house, she fires these creatures, which may reach up to one meter high."
"Carol","BAILLY","(USA, 1955-)","Carol_BAILLY.jpg","An American who emigrated to Switzerland, Carol Bailly started to draw as an autodidact using strong, acid colours in Indian ink, gouache and coloured crayons.  She created sketches filled with lavish details, with women at the centre of her narrative.  She gives them a voice which can be humorous, sarcastic or even tragic.  Frida Khalo, the archetype of the female artist, occupies a preponderant place in her compositions; she plays the role of the artist’s muse and alter-ego."
"Umberto","BERGAMASCHI","(Milan, 1954-)","BERGAMASCHI.jpg","The habit of putting a circle round his subjects arose by chance during the exploratory phase when he was absorbed in copying a coin. Umberto Bergamaschi got great inner satisfaction from it and has never given up the circular shape. Each thing is presented as a pure effigy, without depth, in a foetal universe where space and time are banished. This opting for abstraction and avoidance of reality reflect his tendency to take refuge in a silent universe.He works in the Andrea & Michele painting studio."
"Paul","BLOCKX","(Belgium, 1961–2015)","Paul_BLOCKX.JPG","The graphic work of Paul Blockx immerse the spectator into a world of pain. The artist imposes us, in a strong way and frankly, the hell of his life, the psychic suffering which he is subjected for several years. For him, as for many artists, creation means a release, a way of shouting his pain and of transcending it. He offers us a strong and authentic work which is a reflection of the author’s soul and which contains a symbolic part of his intimate story. Sometimes shocked, sometimes moved, sometimes upset by the message of this self-portrait, no visitor can remain uncaring in front of this work-mirror."
"Anacleto","BORGHI","(Italy, 1921-2008)","Anacleto_BORGHI.jpg",
"Dominique","BOTTEMANE","(Belgique ,1961-)","Dominique_BOTTEMANE.jpg","Famous for his linocuts peopled with animal and feminine figures, Dominique Bottemanne shows great sensitivity.  A great sports enthusiast, he attacks the art of creation like a sportsman.  Wanting to show as much as possible, he sometimes gets involved in complex compositions with elements superimposed and intermingled.  A demanding artist, he goes from linocuts to oil painting, or even to sculpture, tirelessly seeking to achieve the result of which he has dreamed."
"Ignacio","CARLES-TOLRA ","(Spain, 1928-)","CARLES_TOLRA_Ignacio.jpg","Originally, from Spain, Carles-Tolra moved to Zurich at the age of 30 where, self-taught, he embarked on art after discovering the writings of Jean Dubuffet. Encouraged by the latter, with whom he maintained an important correspondence, he started drawing at night after his work as a civil servant for the Red Cross. 
Ignacio Carles-Tolra gradually developed a bestiary of enormous diversity, bringing together birds and other composite creatures, often endowed with multiple members, which he refers to as “creatures.” lgnacio Carles-Tolra works on impulse and in haste, often by series, consumed by a fever to be understood.  “It’s anger that motivates me the most, but I have a lot of fun too,” he confesses.  “I draw to heal myself from daily life.” His work may proceed by accident from a spot, scratch, print or collage."
"Georges","CAUCHY","(France, 1963-)","Georges_CAUCHY","Some people are difficult; we might even call them stubborn! Well, Georges is one such person: very difficult to communicate with, he has nonetheless some truly remarkable bouts of creativity. At such times, every form submits to his will and takes on more intensity. He uses felt-tip pens, which gives luminosity and transparency to his blocks of color. But you are warned: these works are fragile because the felt-tips employed fade in daylight."
"Klaus","COMPAGNIE","(Belgium, 1972-)","Klaus_COMPAGNIE.jpg","During his youth, Klaus Compagnie has already been someone who liked commenting on his anecdotal representations. He works with enthusiasm and obsession on the perfect translation of his world. He sketches rudimentary figures in painting, charcoal or in pyrography combined with written comments. Paintings illustrate his unlimited knowledge and unlimited imagination. He realizes portraits, paints historic facts and confronts us with his anatomical knowledge. He gives meteorological indications or events with a personal interpretation in dutch, but also in spanish and in french. He reinforces pictures by text, what convey his works funny and scheming."
"Phillippe","CONDYLIS","(France, 1959-)","Phillippe_CONDYLIS.jpg",
"Martine","COPENAUT","(Belgium, 1955-2004)","Martine_COPENAUT.jpg","Martine Copenaut discovered drawing and weaving at the same time, which is doubtless why her very colourful graphic compositions, with closely set motifs, seem to illustrate the weft of a tapestry.  Her abstract creations juxtapose rounded geometric forms evoking the blossoming of a flower up to the very edge of the petals; a stream of multi-hued blossoms pushing against one another until there is no white space left."
"Aloïse","CORBAZ ","(Switzerland, 1886-1964)","Aloise_CORBAZ.jpg","Having suffered heartbreak, Aloïse, then aged twenty-five, moves to Germany where she takes up the post of governess at the court of Emperor William II. At the start of the war in 1914 she has to go back to Switzerland, and is showing signs of behavioral problems. Her family decides to first commit her to the hospital in Céry then, from 1918 until her death, to the mental hospital of La Rosière in Gimel. Jacqueline PorretForel, the doctor who looks after her, analyses her works and shows them to Jean Dubuffet. Locked-up, Aloïse creates disconcerting works that follow rules which are hers alone. Memories resurface in her drawings: the splendor of the court of William II, royal couples, and theatrical scenery. She doesn’t reproduce them faithfully, but transfers them into a perpetually changing and extremely diverse world."
"Sylvain","COSIJNS","(Belgium, 1932–2020)","Sylvain_COSIJNS.jpg","Sylvain Cosijns started to live and open up aged 56, when he went to Jan Geldhof’s studio. During his life he accumulated a mass of sensations and experiences, endured and lived through but never communicated. Drawing and painting is his way of reaching out to life and other people. 
The work of Sylvain Cosijns reflects the fragility of things more than heroism: it exudes tremendous purity: bare drawings with a hesitating stroke although maintained."
"Georges","COUNASSE ","(Belgium, 1933-2005)","Georges_Counasse_27.jpg","Eternal enchantment that furrows our childhood memories, the merry-go-rounds of Georges Counasse, a retired baker, turn to the rhythm of record-players that usually serve as their base.  An assembly of elements gleaned from childhood and its rediscovery (small dolls that ride the carrousels, pearls, Christmas garlands, etc.) recreate the fair of the years 1947-1950 of his youth.  Merry-go-round, big wheel, chain carousel, ice palace, and bumper cars awaken a nostalgic happiness in us all."

"Philippe ","DA FONSECA","(Belgium, 1959-)","Da_Fonseca.jpg","When he arrived at La « S » Grand Atelier, in 2000, Philippe Da Fonseca had already acquired an almost intuitive formal vocabulary: ships, churches, trees, suns, moons. We can still distinguish them at times in his later abstract compositions where successive layers create an opaque - transparent interplay. The work of Philippe Da Fonseca has long been strictly painted in black and white but a vivid palette has lately burst out, something which has certainly to do with the arrival of a new colourist art facilitator."
"Caroline","DAHYOT","(France, 1968-)","Caroline_DAHYOT.jpg",
"Antonio","DALLA VALLE ","(Cles (Trente), Italy, 1939-)","Antonio_DALLA VALLE.jpg","Antonio Dalla Valle always carries his work when he leaves the security of his psychiatric institution. It contains notebooks wrapped in sticky tape, assemblages of felt pens, and Perspex cubes in which he encloses small pieces of paper with scribbled text. He has invented a form of personal, secret writing in which the intimate coexists with the universal."
"Michel","DAVE","(Belgium, 1941-2018)","Michel_DAVE.jpg","“Writing is also a form of drawing.” When someone quipped that writing is also drawing, Michel Dave embarks on an abundant production of written drawings, of drawn writings. Graphical lists made by signs whose interest goes beyond their meaning, even if that is ever so important. It is not a string of words dumped there by chance. And if Michel Dave chooses them gingerly in a dictionary, he does not limit himself to recopying slavishly in alphabetical order.  We go from one surprise to another when we cast our gaze on them, jumping from association of sounds to association of meaning, on an itinerary of our eye sustained by more or less rippled dotted lines. Michel Dave started to go to the workshop of La Pommeraie in 1990 and it was after a year of graphical trial and error that he found his way in words. His gesture, which became more fragile as his health declined, was silenced in 2015 following a period of intense production."

"Véronique","DECLERCQ","(Belgium, 1947-)","declercq.jpg","It all starts with a rainbow, tirelessly repeated, with a marker. It all starts with a rainbow, and a dry-point engraving course offered by the artist Chris Delville within the Club Antonin Artaud (Brussels). The gesture of the rainbow takes all its dimension, returns all its depth once applied to the medium, which does not make it possible to repent, just to directly transcribe the waves which come from the inside. Touched by Declercq’s work, Chris Delville suggested her to keep practicing this technique on a weekly basis, in her personal workshop. A creative relationship that has endured since 1997, between the raindrops and the sunbeams that pierce through the windows of the small courtyard, accomplices of the hatching of arches, skies ... waves! … Of whites and grays."
"Serge","DELAUNAY","(Belgium, 1956-)","Serge_DELAUNAY.jpg","In 1978, he joins the Queen Fabiola Centre in Neufvilles where he spends most of his time in the drawing and modelling studio, la Ramée. Being very observant and able to memorise countless details he copies, in his own way, his favourite subjects, i.e. cars, robots, rockets, and any other machine involving complex technology. 
His drawings, made with black felt pen and rotring in ligneclaire style, are supported by texts with technical and mechanical information in which every word seems to be the flagship of the future, the source of progress. Involved with the news and events with intense media coverage, Serge reacts to it and celebrates it in his own way, with empathy and determination.
His drawings and the messages they carry constitute, in the eyes of the visitor, the many relays and traces of an often neglected everyday life. The draughtsman reminds us of our micro-dimension in the face of the space odyssey and its vastness, something the all-knowing Man undoubtedly forgot in his ignorance. Serge delights in this and finds inspiration in these (super) human adventures. To him, these creative moments are synonymous with intense and silent periods of concentration."

"Paul","DUHEM","(Belgium, 1919-1999)","Paul_DUHEM.jpg","Duhem was seventy when he started to draw and paint. He would always work in the same way. First of all he would cut the sheet of paper down to size with a knife, and then use a length of wood to draw a frame around the sheet. In the top left-hand corner he would write his name, also in a little frame. He had learnt to do this long ago at school. When he worked with paint, he would not use a palette, but emptied the pots into sardine tins. Because of this, his paintings have a restricted number of colors. He never washed out his brushes. The paint became mixed together, and by the time the pots were nearly empty, his work would take on an olive-brown tint. Although Duhem only started painting late in life, he left behind a large body of work. The endless repetition of the same themes gives this work a somewhat enigmatic quality. It is as though there is something that Duhem is always trying to grasp or capture."

"Johan","GEENENS","(Belgium, 1970-)","geenens.jpg","Johan Geenens has been attending the De Zandberg workshops in Harelbeke since 1992. Starting off with engraving and linocut, his artistic practices expanded into abstract painting and drawing. His “Nogeenkasteel” series (“One more castle”) is composed of entangled lines transformed into distinct, small spaces and interweaved areas. They all take part in a subtle mosaic of colors and forms, at times alternating with wider spaces where his brash strokes (if it is about painting) OR drawing line (if it is about drawing) become freer and less systematic. These contrasts in styles and density invite the viewer to appreciate in each one of the elements of this ensemble its own distinct features."

“I really enjoy taking a shoe apart, discovering its structure, identifying what it’s made of, from the most refined materials to the most ordinary, hand-made or machine-made. It was a bit like taking an engine apart but not so dirty.” A television programme made him want to start painting. One day a new sole he had just fitted, its smell, its shape and its texture, made it the ideal support. He painted a small landscape on it, to which the reactions of his customers varied: “The first time I decorated the soles unasked the lady was delighted. But another customer wasn’t at all pleased.” Juanma’s works are not forgotten, they wear away.

"Martha","GRÜNENWALDT ","(Belgium, 1910–2008)","Martha_GRUNENWALDT.jpg","The artistic activity of Martha Grünenwaldt began in 1981, when she was seventy-one. On the back of a poster or wallpaper, she drew brightly colored pictures with a woman as the apparent centre point. Beside and around the face she painted birds, a violinist, plant motifs, even buildings. 
Over the years, these motifs took over the space from the portraits and in some cases became a tangle of vegetation obscuring Martha completely."

And do they offer them to us, these representations, or are they personal explorations? Do they link up with the outside world or do they participate in this retreating life imposed by the various handicaps the artist carries, including deafness and mutism? Josef Hofer started his graphic work at the age of 40, in creative workshops. A marked sexual character, framing that could be described as haphazard, and always the repetition of this frame made of yellow and red-orange lines ... Which corresponds to the frame of his mirror, placed at the foot of his bed, in his bedroom… Place to explore his body, in reflection, in parts."

"David","HOUIS","(Belgium, 1989-)","David_HOUIS.jpg","David Houis’s drawings invite the viewer to become the protagonist of the image, thus turning the spectator firstly into the driver of a Formula 1 car, then the pilot of jet fighter, or even, finally, a gamer.  An extraordinary artist, with one energetic stroke, David Houis can interpret the perspectives and details of scenes in movement: motor racing, a plane landing or taking off and even scenes of war.  Every drawing is teeming with precise details realised meticulously, demonstrating his love and his patience."
,"JAKLINE","(Belgium, 1956-)","JAKLINE.jpg","Jakline does not speak readily about her work. (Jakline's work is not a deliberate act of self-expression) Her actions and artwork speak for her instead. She makes lace. One that stings, gets rusty and transmits tetanus. That is chiseled up by fullness and emptiness. Void as some devastated land, abandoned to the projection of our fears/anxieties. A sort of space, inside her iron and nickel cathedrals, where floats the echo of her revolt cried out in silence."

"Alexis","LIPPSTREU","(France, 1972-)","Lippstreu.jpg","Alexis Lippstreu lives in La Pommeraie (Hainaut, Belgium) and attends the creative workshop led by Bruno Gérard. His interest in drawing is complemented by an obsessive repetition of the themes chosen from Manet, Gauguin or Seurat. These masters do not attract him for a precise technique but rather for the imagery they have created. Raw, strong and speechless, they penetrate Alexis’ mind, who gives them a filtered, refined substance in which humans have an important role. The formal stereotype given to bodies is misleading to the distracted eye. Rich in diverse expressions, each schematic presence has their own life, which individualizes them in their false twinning. Centered on a few details, the graphics of Alexis are economical and give way to a great breathability of composition. There is a radiographic softness in his being as a designer."

He faithfully retraces his journeys, the paths that he crosses, and the places that have marked him and given him pleasure.  A colourist, he uses marker pens, crayons and Tipp-Ex most frequently in order to saturate the surface of the support.  The rendering of his perspectives is audacious, nervous and very lively.  Very attached to the minutest detail, he faithfully reproduces everything meticulously: road signs, manhole covers, electric wiring, zebra crossings, even the reflection of a tree in the mirror above his washbasin.  On the back of his sheet of paper, he describes very exactly the situation he has experienced and illustrated on the other side.  This is his logbook: the intimate diary of his existence, punctuated with journeys, places and the moments of his life."
"Richard","MOSZKOWICZ","(Belgium, 1945-)","MOSZKOWICZ.jpg","Residing in a rest home very close to the Art et marges museum, Richard Moszkowicz takes the road several times a week to go to the plastic arts workshop at Créahm-Brussels. Although it started late (in 1997), it was with youthful freshness that the practice of painting came into his life. The energy that emanates from his compositions comes from lively tones but also from the writing work of an ""intimate journal"". Everyday facts have graphic value just as much as they contribute to self-development."
"Antoine","MVUMBI","(Belgium, 1974-)","AntoineMVUMBI.jpg","The works of Antoine Mvumbi are very colourful compositions realised essentially in oil pastels.  His first productions were distinguished by the juxtaposition of blocks of colour.  These works are very graphic, showing the audience fragments of architecture, giving the sensation of a split screen connected to surveillance cameras.  Gradually, his drawings started to feature images from magazines: Antoine Mvumbi appropriates all images and synthesizes them using his extraordinary faculty of observation and keen sense of composition."
"Michel","NEDJAR","(France, 1947-)","michelnedjar.jpg","Michel Nedjar, the man with dolls! He draws also, often in series, always by instinct, but the dolls undeniably constitute the trademark of his work. They are made of fabrics similar to those that Nedjar sold with his grandmother at the Clignancourt flee market.  These old fabrics, “Schmattess,” as his mother called them in Yiddish, are preferred by the artist over the fine fabrics of his father’s  tailor shop. The dolls are initially modelled on traditional dolls but are then gradually transformed into tortured, charred looking bodies. The artist thus exorcises the images he is obsessed with, namely the horror of the concentration camps, a horror that marked his family but which he discovered only in 1960 through the images of the film of Alain Resnais “Night and Fog.”  Later, the dolls become multicoloured. They are no longer transformed by dye or mud, but bear “scars” that go through a body stuffed with objects. You can easily imagine a teapot appearing here, a doll’s shoe there… they carry a story, that of their author, that of the erstwhile owners of fabrics or objects.  They are universal."
"Marion","OSTER","(Niger, 1960-)","marionoster.jpg","Marion Oster conveys an entire world of ritual magic steeped in her childhood in Africa and interests in non-European civilisations. Enchantment and wonder emerge from kitsch derision thanks to assembling talent. The sacred, which transcends and gives value, is distilled from the religious dimension. The detailed and patient work leads to creations of enormous freedom which brings us to the heart of reinvented folklore and traditions. Marion Oster puts her passion at the service of a collection that brings together a shared sensitivity, from outsider art to peculiar art via popular art. She has for that matter defended the work of these artists in two galleries which she kept fire in the belly (or “Le coeur au ventre”, the name of her second gallery) in Paris, then in Lyon."

She was initiated in interpretive drawing by the painter Luc Mondry, in the workshop of La Clairière and her work developed into a highly personal view of the subjects broached. Another aspect of her work is her series of tiles, probably due to the few months she spent in a mosaic studio. Locked in a repetitive system that she has wrought with rigour, her approach is devoid of monotony nonetheless. Her choice in the harmony of colours confers a pleasure that is renewed each time."

A multi-disciplinary artist he is also a musician:  percussion improvisations on rubbish bins using empty cartridges placed at the end of the fingers, accordion and harmonica accompanied by very personal songs. 
Present in the largest outsider art collections, this anti-conformist and anti-militarist artist beckons the viewers in a playful manner in spite of himself.

The body is outlined only roughly, the fixed gazes draw all the attention.

Does this gesture remind him of the hours spent watching his sister-in-law knitting? If making a knot is probably the easiest way to hold two threads together, by multiplying them, Pascal Tassini, like a tightrope walker, creates on the line of balance. And on his own initiative, the first ""balls"" of fabrics, with precious packaging of furniture recovered or borrowed forever (tables, chairs, ladders), keychains of a fantasy wedding (dresses, floral bouquets, hats), encrypted love letters, or unexpected gifts, always the meticulous choice of materials.
