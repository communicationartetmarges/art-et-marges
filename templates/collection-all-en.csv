"Diyana","AFSAR","(Belgium, 1987-)","DIYANA_AFSAR.jpg","Diyana Afsar is active in the visual art workshop of Creahmbxl. Diyana Afsar draws figures easily recognizable: their collected bodies move on a pair of endless legs. Another characteristic is: the details of the clothes, as the coat of the animals, are reproduced with a loving care of the detail. Her characters face us, their eyes on the edge of their faces, and they wear broad smiles, perhaps because they live in company. Diyana Afsar works with acrylic paint, felt pen or with pencils and she represents a lot of families, including famous or atypical, with a predilection for the crowned heads or the singer Ricky Martin. Her full-length portraits are accompanied by whimsical captions: the information has been remixed by the artist. Generous, Diyana Afsar offers to the others the sociability which transpires in her work. (Text: Créahmbxl, Anita Van Belle)"
"Yassir","AMAZINE","(Belgium, 1975- )","Yassir_AMAZINE.jpg","Yassir Amazine attended the classes of Luc Mondry and Nicole Babilas at La Clarière.His drawings are in ball point, black, red, green or blue. He sings or hums while drawing, and speaks rarely or not at all. In fact, is he singing? Is he drawing? Or is he running away? He never looks for a model for his drawings. Some subjects are repeated: sun, house and mosque, aeroplane, car, guitar. An apparent disorder but the paper is entirely covered (usually both sides), it all makes sense. Yassir Amazine has finished his drawing, and has stopped singing. The drawing begins its own life, it exists in its own right, nourished by the artist."
"Inès","ANDOUCHE","(Belgium, 1958-)","Ines_ANDOUCHE.JPG","For the ten years in her life she lived an itinerant life with her parents in Africa, principally in the Congo. In 1961 Inès return in Europe and attended several different institutions in Switzerland and then in France, where she joined Hemptinne Centre’s creative studio. She draws with great intensity. With strong gestures she tackles pictures in magazines, taking them over and giving them a new life. This apparently simple mental transfer dignifies the insignificant, the ordinary or even the ignored. Her univers probably conveys some memories of the culture of her childhood, today conducted by a strong artistic personality."
"Seyni","AWA CAMARA","(Senegal, 1939-)","Seyni_CAMARA.jpg","Seyni Awa has always contested ancestral prohibitions. She has displayed her eccentricity, her fantasies and the “evil” spirits inside her.  She makes fun of the rules and gives full rein to all her fantasies. In the yard in front of the house, she models her clay figures, half-women, half-monsters and produces other little laughing monsters. In a hole, the most rudimentary kiln imaginable, also in front of the house, she fires these creatures, which may reach up to one meter high."
"Aimé","BAHATI","(Rwanda, 1984-, lives in Belgium)","AIME_BAHATI.jpg","Aimé Bahati’s structures are carefully and meticulously built from materials recovered from here and there. The artist models his dreams in miniature. Carrying a physical handicap, he imagines means of locomotion, helicopters, planes, boats that would facilitate his movements and relieve his mother. He also invented luxurious villas with subtle and elegant decorations. Aimé Bahati fled Rwanda for Europe with his mother in 1995. He has been living and working in Liège since."
"Carol","BAILLY","(USA, 1955-)","Carol_BAILLY.jpg","An American who emigrated to Switzerland, Carol Bailly started to draw as an autodidact using strong, acid colours in Indian ink, gouache and coloured crayons.  She created sketches filled with lavish details, with women at the centre of her narrative.  She gives them a voice which can be humorous, sarcastic or even tragic.  Frida Khalo, the archetype of the female artist, occupies a preponderant place in her compositions; she plays the role of the artist’s muse and alter-ego."
"Umberto","BERGAMASCHI","(Milan, 1954-)","BERGAMASCHI.jpg","The habit of putting a circle round his subjects arose by chance during the exploratory phase when he was absorbed in copying a coin. Umberto Bergamaschi got great inner satisfaction from it and has never given up the circular shape. Each thing is presented as a pure effigy, without depth, in a foetal universe where space and time are banished. This opting for abstraction and avoidance of reality reflect his tendency to take refuge in a silent universe.He works in the Andrea & Michele painting studio."
"Ariane ","BERGRICHTER","(Germany, 1937-Belgium, 1996)","ARIANE_BERGRICHTER.jpg","Here is a world teeming with ballpoint pens and felt tip pens, cafés, people seated at tables, windows with a view on the street, tram stops, passersby and artists, old ladies with small dogs straining at the leash, waiters and workers. “It’s simply crazy the number of tiles I need…” says a roofer amongst the tumult of images of drawings sketched from life in the heart of Brussels at the end of the 1980s, beginning of the 1990s. “It’s simply amazing …”, the number of sketches, beer coasters, bits of sticky paper, the hours spent observing the world go by in bars and assembling it all together, so that Ariane Bergrichter could turn the complex psyche of her life into a work of art. When she passed away in 1996, there were so many written notes and sketches that bore witness to how difficult her life had been. Her daughter stuffed them all into a suitcase and, some 20 years later, they emerged to reveal this remarkable work. In 2018, the assembled drawings of Ariane Bergrichter were exhibited for the first time at the American Folk Art Museum in New York. Now, with SMILE. I LOVE IT! in 2022 the ART ET MARGES MUSEUM exhibited the first monographic exhibition of this artist’s work."
"Paul","BLOCKX","(Belgium, 1961–2015)","Paul_BLOCKX.JPG","The graphic work of Paul Blockx immerse the spectator into a world of pain. The artist imposes us, in a strong way and frankly, the hell of his life, the psychic suffering which he is subjected for several years. For him, as for many artists, creation means a release, a way of shouting his pain and of transcending it. He offers us a strong and authentic work which is a reflection of the author’s soul and which contains a symbolic part of his intimate story. Sometimes shocked, sometimes moved, sometimes upset by the message of this self-portrait, no visitor can remain uncaring in front of this work-mirror."
"Anacleto","BORGHI","(Italy, 1921-2008)","Anacleto_BORGHI.jpg","We have a few fragile sculptures and oil paintings from Anacleto Borghi.  He painted charming landscapes from an early age, rubbing shoulders with Bohemian artists before embarking, at the end of his life, on the creation of sculptures using items he found in the hospital.  These findings contributed to his creations in which he used, as the main materials, paper towels and painter's tape for embellishment.  Birds, flowers under a bell, a deer, a cat... all come to life in his hands before being generously painted.  Anacleto Borghi was active in the Adriano e Michele studio at the Fatebenefratelli psychiatric rehabilitation centre in San Colombano al Lombro (Italy).",,,,,,,,,,
"Dominique","BOTTEMANE","(Belgique ,1961-)","Dominique_BOTTEMANE.jpg","Famous for his linocuts peopled with animal and feminine figures, Dominique Bottemanne shows great sensitivity.  A great sports enthusiast, he attacks the art of creation like a sportsman.  Wanting to show as much as possible, he sometimes gets involved in complex compositions with elements superimposed and intermingled.  A demanding artist, he goes from linocuts to oil painting, or even to sculpture, tirelessly seeking to achieve the result of which he has dreamed."
"Ignacio","CARLES-TOLRA ","(Spain, 1928-)","CARLES_TOLRA_Ignacio.jpg","Originally, from Spain, Carles-Tolra moved to Zurich at the age of 30 where, self-taught, he embarked on art after discovering the writings of Jean Dubuffet. Encouraged by the latter, with whom he maintained an important correspondence, he started drawing at night after his work as a civil servant for the Red Cross. 
Ignacio Carles-Tolra gradually developed a bestiary of enormous diversity, bringing together birds and other composite creatures, often endowed with multiple members, which he refers to as “creatures.” lgnacio Carles-Tolra works on impulse and in haste, often by series, consumed by a fever to be understood.  “It’s anger that motivates me the most, but I have a lot of fun too,” he confesses.  “I draw to heal myself from daily life.” His work may proceed by accident from a spot, scratch, print or collage."
"Georges","CAUCHY","(France, 1963-)","Georges_CAUCHY","Some people are difficult; we might even call them stubborn! Well, Georges is one such person: very difficult to communicate with, he has nonetheless some truly remarkable bouts of creativity. At such times, every form submits to his will and takes on more intensity. He uses felt-tip pens, which gives luminosity and transparency to his blocks of color. But you are warned: these works are fragile because the felt-tips employed fade in daylight."
"Klaus","COMPAGNIE","(Belgium, 1972-)","Klaus_COMPAGNIE.jpg","During his youth, Klaus Compagnie has already been someone who liked commenting on his anecdotal representations. He works with enthusiasm and obsession on the perfect translation of his world. He sketches rudimentary figures in painting, charcoal or in pyrography combined with written comments. Paintings illustrate his unlimited knowledge and unlimited imagination. He realizes portraits, paints historic facts and confronts us with his anatomical knowledge. He gives meteorological indications or events with a personal interpretation in dutch, but also in spanish and in french. He reinforces pictures by text, what convey his works funny and scheming."
"Phillippe","CONDYLIS","(France, 1959-)","Phillippe_CONDYLIS.jpg","For Philippe Condylis, drawing is an essential activity.  His works, painted instinctively, focus on the female body.  Starting out with complex compositions in which faces and bodies were interwoven… his work has become more simplified.  This has resulted in more expressive drawings in which the female body becomes foliage or an angel.  His drawings have acquired the presence of fetishes, of transitional body-objects.",,,,,,,,,,
"Martine","COPENAUT","(Belgium, 1955-2004)","Martine_COPENAUT.jpg","Martine Copenaut discovered drawing and weaving at the same time, which is doubtless why her very colourful graphic compositions, with closely set motifs, seem to illustrate the weft of a tapestry.  Her abstract creations juxtapose rounded geometric forms evoking the blossoming of a flower up to the very edge of the petals; a stream of multi-hued blossoms pushing against one another until there is no white space left."
"Aloïse","CORBAZ ","(Switzerland, 1886-1964)","Aloise_CORBAZ.jpg","Having suffered heartbreak, Aloïse, then aged twenty-five, moves to Germany where she takes up the post of governess at the court of Emperor William II. At the start of the war in 1914 she has to go back to Switzerland, and is showing signs of behavioral problems. Her family decides to first commit her to the hospital in Céry then, from 1918 until her death, to the mental hospital of La Rosière in Gimel. Jacqueline PorretForel, the doctor who looks after her, analyses her works and shows them to Jean Dubuffet. Locked-up, Aloïse creates disconcerting works that follow rules which are hers alone. Memories resurface in her drawings: the splendor of the court of William II, royal couples, and theatrical scenery. She doesn’t reproduce them faithfully, but transfers them into a perpetually changing and extremely diverse world."
"Sylvain","COSIJNS","(Belgium, 1932–2020)","Sylvain_COSIJNS.jpg","Sylvain Cosijns started to live and open up aged 56, when he went to Jan Geldhof’s studio. During his life he accumulated a mass of sensations and experiences, endured and lived through but never communicated. Drawing and painting is his way of reaching out to life and other people. 
The work of Sylvain Cosijns reflects the fragility of things more than heroism: it exudes tremendous purity: bare drawings with a hesitating stroke although maintained."
"Georges","COUNASSE ","(Belgium, 1933-2005)","Georges_Counasse_27.jpg","Eternal enchantment that furrows our childhood memories, the merry-go-rounds of Georges Counasse, a retired baker, turn to the rhythm of record-players that usually serve as their base.  An assembly of elements gleaned from childhood and its rediscovery (small dolls that ride the carrousels, pearls, Christmas garlands, etc.) recreate the fair of the years 1947-1950 of his youth.  Merry-go-round, big wheel, chain carousel, ice palace, and bumper cars awaken a nostalgic happiness in us all."
"Kazimierz","CYCON","(Poland, 1931-2004)","Kazimierz_CYCON.jpg","Kazimierz Cycon tirelessly depicted the same motif.  A figure with its head bowed, appearing prostrate, its eyes more or less hallucinating.  His pictorial work, which he began at the age of 42, has become increasingly graphic, in an infinite range of colours.  Refusing all contact with others, he has rejected the advice of the doctors and therapists around him.  His creations reflect the inward-looking attitude that characterises him.",,,,,,,,,,
"Hilde","D’HONDT","(Belgium, 1956-)","Hylde_DHONDT.jpg","The works of Hilde D’Hondt works are truly intimate.  After the death of her mother, she created a wreath for her grave while working in the Zonnelied weaving studio where she has been established since the early 1990s.  This delicate and fragile work of art embodies all the love and the grief she felt at the loss of her mother.  Before this mourning period, she created “textile collages” with a great diversity of colours and materials.  Her work inspires a particular look into the material and the sense of touch."
"Philippe ","DA FONSECA","(Belgium, 1959-)","Da_Fonseca.jpg","When he arrived at La « S » Grand Atelier, in 2000, Philippe Da Fonseca had already acquired an almost intuitive formal vocabulary: ships, churches, trees, suns, moons. We can still distinguish them at times in his later abstract compositions where successive layers create an opaque - transparent interplay. The work of Philippe Da Fonseca has long been strictly painted in black and white but a vivid palette has lately burst out, something which has certainly to do with the arrival of a new colourist art facilitator."
"Caroline","DAHYOT","(France, 1968-)","Caroline_DAHYOT.jpg","From her ‘Villa Verveine’ perched overlooking the English Channel, Caroline Dahyot has created an ideal, protective world for herself and others, where those she loves feel safe and secure.  She has been drawing and sewing since 2006, and her works have now taken over her home in its entirety, covering the floor, walls and ceilings with frescoes and drawings.
Like a kindly witch, she makes dolls and drawings in the likeness of her loved ones: her children, her friends and even her lovers, she then adorns with cats’ heads, transforming them into imaginary creatures who will never disappoint.  Her restorative art helps to spread a message of universal love.  That is the very essence that strikes you when you meet her: the love that emanates from her, which she passes on to everyone who crosses her path.",,,,,,,,,, 
"Antonio","DALLA VALLE ","(Cles (Trente), Italy, 1939-2020)","Antonio_DALLA VALLE.jpg","Antonio Dalla Valle always carries his work when he leaves the security of his psychiatric institution. It contains notebooks wrapped in sticky tape, assemblages of felt pens, and Perspex cubes in which he encloses small pieces of paper with scribbled text. He has invented a form of personal, secret writing in which the intimate coexists with the universal."
"Michel","DAVE","(Belgium, 1941-2018)","Michel_DAVE.jpg","“Writing is also a form of drawing.” When someone quipped that writing is also drawing, Michel Dave embarks on an abundant production of written drawings, of drawn writings. Graphical lists made by signs whose interest goes beyond their meaning, even if that is ever so important. It is not a string of words dumped there by chance. And if Michel Dave chooses them gingerly in a dictionary, he does not limit himself to recopying slavishly in alphabetical order.  We go from one surprise to another when we cast our gaze on them, jumping from association of sounds to association of meaning, on an itinerary of our eye sustained by more or less rippled dotted lines. Michel Dave started to go to the workshop of La Pommeraie in 1990 and it was after a year of graphical trial and error that he found his way in words. His gesture, which became more fragile as his health declined, was silenced in 2015 following a period of intense production."
"Heide","DE BRUYNE","(Belgium, 1955-)","Heide_DEBRUYNE.jpg","The main motifs in Heide De Bruyne's work are the junctions and links woven into the material.  She finds her inspiration in nature, plants, willow branches, threads, etc., which she then knots together to form three-dimensional structures that become magmas of lines and shapes.  They look like storks' nests, giant spider cocoons and plant installations worthy of renowned artists.  Heide De Bruyne works at the Zonnelied studio, Lennik (Belgium).",,,,,,,,,,
"Willy","DE SMEDT","(Belgium, 1943-)","Willy_DESMEDT.jpg","Willy De Smedt has been attending the Créahmbxl art workshop since 1998. The first gesture: drawing a rectangle. Willy De Smedt’s abstract painting is elaborated layer after layer. During the process, the aligned rectangles, drawn with acrylic, take on color. Then, others come to superimpose them in shift. The material accumulates. The new shades - perhaps pastel - blend with the previous ones. The rhythm of Willy De Smedt’s paintings, their vibration, is born from these overlaps. When the work is finished, it has acquired its singular depth. The eye crosses these doubled porticoes and immerses itself in the color. (Text: Créahmbxl, Anita Van Belle)"
"Éric","DE SULAUZE","(France, 1963-)","ERIC_DE_SULAUZE.jpg","Éric De Sulauze attended the art workshop of the Pré-texte, Brussels. Eric de Sulauze gives a major place to the rituals that he executes before starting to create. For example, sharpening his pens to experience the smell of freshly cut wood is a great pleasure for him. He also needs a table for him alone to draw. He crushes his colouring pencils to form his shapes, and often fills the space on the paper twice to get a velvety touch to his drawings."
"Sieberen","DE VRIES","(Netherland, 1969-)","SieberenDeVRIES.jpg","Sieberen De Vries has gradually moved into portrait painting, depicting the faces of famous people.  In his work, however, he never idealises the men and women he paints.  Their large eyes cling tenaciously to the viewer.  Their wrinkled foreheads, gleaming teeth, media-savvy grimaces and freckled faces immediately appeal, thanks to Sieberen's grand brushstrokes.",,,,,,,,,,
"Véronique","DECLERCQ","(Belgium, 1965-2021)","declercq.jpg","It all starts with a rainbow, tirelessly repeated, with a marker. It all starts with a rainbow, and a dry-point engraving course offered by the artist Chris Delville within the Club Antonin Artaud (Brussels). The gesture of the rainbow takes all its dimension, returns all its depth once applied to the medium, which does not make it possible to repent, just to directly transcribe the waves which come from the inside. Touched by Declercq’s work, Chris Delville suggested her to keep practicing this technique on a weekly basis, in her personal workshop. A creative relationship that has endured since 1997, between the raindrops and the sunbeams that pierce through the windows of the small courtyard, accomplices of the hatching of arches, skies ... waves! … Of whites and grays."
"Serge","DELAUNAY","(Belgium, 1956-2021)","Serge_DELAUNAY.jpg","Serge Delaunay worked at the Campagn'art workshop from 1978 to 2021. His drawings, made with black felt pen and rotring in ligneclaire style, are supported by texts with technical and mechanical information in which every word seems to be the flagship of the future, the source of progress. His drawings remind us of our micro-dimension in the face of the space odyssey and its vastness. Through artistic creation, Serge Delaunay has created ""his"" Space Odyssey as a substitute existence."
"Eric","DERKENNE","(Belgium, 1960-2014)","Eric_DERKENNE.jpg","It is the circles that hold the whole composition together, with a nose and sometimes arms drifting around them.  As the creation progressed, the need to fill the whole sheet grew.  At La S Grand Atelier, where he was active, the facilitators offered him a variety of techniques.  He tried them out and then made a deliberate choice: to use the ballpoint pen exclusively.  For fifteen years, Éric Derkenne worked alone on the same table at the back of the studio but, towards the end, he finally agreed to use walnut stain, ecoline (liquid  paint for watercolours) or Indian ink to add colour and substance to his ‘face works’.",,,,,,,,,,
"Curzio","DI GIOVANNI","(Italy, 1957-)","CurzioDiGIOVANNI.jpg","Curzio Di Giovanni models his work on the stars featured in glossy magazines.  He strives to reproduce every detail with the same importance, a shadow having the same value as an ear or a nose.  The result is a fragmented flattening of these faces that takes on a grating allure, as though the author was criticizing the capitalist system of which these images are the vector.  Curzio Di Giovanni attends the ‘Adriano e Michele’ studio at the Fatebenefratelli Centre in San Colombano, near Milan.",,,,,,,,,,
"Georges","DUESBERG","(Belgium, 1944-1995)","GEORGES_DUESBERG.jpg","For years, Georges Duesberg has been the graphical chronicler of events that had marked the week at the Centre de la Pommeraie (Quevaucamps). His models are borrowed from magazines and reinterpreted in colours that come pure out of their pot, after a composition in pencil – a composition previously annotated by colouring according to a likewise reinterpreted vocabulary: “light browned,” “dark mauved”…"
"Paul","DUHEM","(Belgium, 1919-1999)","Paul_DUHEM.jpg","Duhem was seventy when he started to draw and paint. He would always work in the same way. First of all he would cut the sheet of paper down to size with a knife, and then use a length of wood to draw a frame around the sheet. In the top left-hand corner he would write his name, also in a little frame. He had learnt to do this long ago at school. When he worked with paint, he would not use a palette, but emptied the pots into sardine tins. Because of this, his paintings have a restricted number of colors. He never washed out his brushes. The paint became mixed together, and by the time the pots were nearly empty, his work would take on an olive-brown tint. Although Duhem only started painting late in life, he left behind a large body of work. The endless repetition of the same themes gives this work a somewhat enigmatic quality. It is as though there is something that Duhem is always trying to grasp or capture."
"Frédéric","ETIENNE","(Belgium, 1965-)","FredericETIENNE.jpg","Spring and autumn are the hunting grounds for Frédéric Étienne's creations.  ‘Two seasons of light’, he says.  They offer a playground for new forms, nourished by the salvaged materials he gathers between the deserted cobblestones of the flea market at Place du Jeu de Balle.  Cartoon figures, plastic animals, paper umbrellas, a colourful anthology... form the autumn foliage or bursting spring buds of his sculptures.  Each floor invites you to another in the gigantic scale of small items stuck to one another.
Discovered in the heart of the Marolles district, this tower was a natural addition to the Art et marges museum collection.  The proximity of the artist also means that we can call on him to reattach any loose parts from time to time.",,,,,,,,,,
"Yves-Jules","FLEURI","(France, 1960-)","Yves_Jules_FLEURI.jpg","Flat areas of acrylic and dark outlines are the constants in the work of Yves-Jules Fleuri, who has been working in the Campagn'art studio in Neufvilles since 1997.  He specialises in royal and presidential portraits, but also reproduces all kinds of images, from tarot cards to classic paintings, imprinting them with his own distinctive style that distorts them into squeaky characters with carnivorous smiles or luscious lips in a pop aesthetic.  His works are always framed by a frame designed by the artist himself, featuring the caption.  As colourful as his paintings, Yves-Jules Fleuri is also a magician.",,,,,,,,,, 
"Cecile","FRANCEUS","(Belgium, 1962-2008)","Cecile_FRANCEUS.jpg","Cécile Franceus expresses herself in a gestural style that does not become an identifiable shape.  The strokes vigorously applied to the paper are accompanied by the sound of a ball-point pen scratching on a table, the incessant repetition, and the insistent music that accompanies her gestures.  For her, the creative process is more important than the result achieved; it is a medium of existence and the confirmation that she is indeed living.  When a page has a hole in it, she slides a second sheet beneath it, tears and glues the paper until, for some unknown and unexplained reason, she stops working and decides that the work is finished.  This cessation of work is guided by an inner voice and not by some external material contingencies, for even when her pen has run out of ink she continues to use it as a scraper!  The mystery and the miracle of her gestural style reside in the existential message that they embody. Cécile Franceus created her work at the Zonnelied studio in Lennik (Belgium)."
,"FRANKLIN","(Portugal)","FRANKLIN.jpg","Franklin's meticulous, precise works, often created with the aid of a magnifying glass, are born of the thoughts and poems that accompany him.  His ornamental mazes owe much to 19th century writers, including John Keats, the Brontë sisters and Emily Dickinson, and this is undoubtedly what makes them so timeless; if they are not of now, they are perhaps of always.",,,,,,,,,,
"Jill","GALLIENI","(France, 1948-)","Jill_GALLIENI.jpg","These sentences, so tightly strung together as to be illegible, are in fact prayers. Jill Galliéni addresses them first to Saint Rita and then to the Virgin Mary.  She felt the need to start this practice around the age of thirty, she then abandoned it for several years, wondering if her spirituality could take on a material form; she then took it up again once she felt reassured about it.  Jill Galliéni has also created unique textile dolls, where her prayers can be distinguished since they were not created for the purpose of being seen by an audience."
"Johan","GEENENS","(Belgium, 1970-)","geenens.jpg","Johan Geenens has been attending the De Zandberg workshops in Harelbeke since 1992. Starting off with engraving and linocut, his artistic practices expanded into abstract painting and drawing. His “Nogeenkasteel” series (“One more castle”) is composed of entangled lines transformed into distinct, small spaces and interweaved areas. They all take part in a subtle mosaic of colors and forms, at times alternating with wider spaces where his brash strokes (if it is about painting) OR drawing line (if it is about drawing) become freer and less systematic. These contrasts in styles and density invite the viewer to appreciate in each one of the elements of this ensemble its own distinct features."
"Irène","GERARD","(Belgium, 1958-)","Irene_GERARD.jpg","Bodies lingering like so many fragments assembled, then glued back together in the manner of Kintsugi, the Japanese practice of gluing broken objects back together by sublimating the repair with gold.  Yet, it is more often with a black outline that Irène Gérard interweaves the kaleidoscopic beings that emerge from her brush.  Self-portraits, famous works of art and personalities are among the subjects that gain in presence, strangeness and depth from the artist's intervention.  Irène Gérard has been working at La S Grand Atelier since 2007.",,,,,,,,,,
"Madge","GILL","(England, 1882-1961)","Madge_GILL.jpg","Madge Gill (London, UK) is one ofthe leading female figures inoutsider art.  A mediumistic (or spiritualistic) artist, she said that she was guided by  a spirit of the name of "Myrninerest", which could be translatedas“My Inner Rest [Self],” or “My innerest.” She started to draw, write and embroider when she lostthe use of her left eye due to an illness. She workedvery rapidly, all through the night, by candlelight, in a state close to a trance. It was only after she died in 1961, that hundreds of drawings were found piled up in cupboards and under the bed that would go on to enrich the world’s biggest outsider art collections.",,,,,,,,,,
"Daniel","GONÇALVES","(Portugal, 1977-)","DANIEL_GONCALVES.jpg","The compositions of Daniel Gonçalves are bewitching. They seem to contain a mystery, as if the artist mastered a magical language able to translate the hidden mechanisms of the world. These art pieces are shaped during the night, according to a precise and unchanging ritual, Daniel Gonçalves always creates with the same tools, a pen and a compass, on the same chair and always facing east. He creates without sketches, in a meditative focus state, close to a state of trance, connected, according to him, to universal psychic forces. Gradually, the artist is committed in circular compositions more and more geometric in an attempt to reach perfection: « I hope to transmit purity, precision, perfection, balance, and passing on this energy to the viewers, based on elements that are common to all » (interview in RAW VISION, n°101)."
"Juanma","GONZALEZ","(Spain, 1945 – Belgium, 2007)","Juanma_GONZALEZ.jpg","He was a driver and became a cobbler.
“I really enjoy taking a shoe apart, discovering its structure, identifying what it’s made of, from the most refined materials to the most ordinary, hand-made or machine-made. It was a bit like taking an engine apart but not so dirty.” A television programme made him want to start painting. One day a new sole he had just fitted, its smell, its shape and its texture, made it the ideal support. He painted a small landscape on it, to which the reactions of his customers varied: “The first time I decorated the soles unasked the lady was delighted. But another customer wasn’t at all pleased.” Juanma’s works are not forgotten, they wear away."
"Michel","GOYON","(France, 1963-)","MichelGOYON.jpg","For almost thirty years, Michel Goyon has been creating a fascinating virtuoso game of colouring and cutting with notebooks which take the form of animated books one could compare to pop-up books. This multidimensional work invites us to witness the hybridisation of imaginations. A hybridisation which, because of its kinetic dimension, acquires almost cinematic aspects. The artist not only finds inspiration in comic strips, illustration, and even more so in a very specific comic strip “genre”, i.e. that of science-fiction, but also in general dictionaries and encyclopaedias which he consults avidly and from which he draws patterns, images he integrates and reinterprets in his world and in his own unique and personal way."
"Martha","GRÜNENWALDT ","(Belgium, 1910–2008)","Martha_GRUNENWALDT.jpg","The artistic activity of Martha Grünenwaldt began in 1981, when she was seventy-one. On the back of a poster or wallpaper, she drew brightly colored pictures with a woman as the apparent centre point. Beside and around the face she painted birds, a violinist, plant motifs, even buildings. 
Over the years, these motifs took over the space from the portraits and in some cases became a tangle of vegetation obscuring Martha completely."
"Oscar","HAUS","(Belgium, 1939-2018)","Oscar_HAUS.jpg","Despite being retired, Oscar Haus visits La Pommeraie centre's painting studio every day to talk about various things, but above all of his love for music (he has played the accordion since childhood).  It was during these visits that Bruno Gérard, the studio leader, invited him to come and take part in the studio’s activities.  Oscar Haus then began to draw everyday things using coloured pencils.  It would be some time before he developed a distinctive body of work, with the accordion as his central and unique theme.  Over time, a book on the accordion (given to him by a centre employee) and the discovery of Karisma coloured pencils, with an intensity like no other, led to the development of his remarkable body of work.",,,,,,,,,,
"Hendrik","HEFFINCK","(Belgium, 1965-)","Hendrik_HEFFINCK.jpg","Hendrik Heffinck, an installationi artist, came to assemblage via painting. Little by little, he started integrating objects in it, giving them an air of combine painting à la Rauschenberg. Soon there would only be objects, assembled with any links and ties he happened upon.
‘Kunst’ (art): that is what Hendrik Heffinck calls all of his creations. No law can possibly apply to all outsider artists:realty is many-sided. Whereas some of them have no access to the concept of art, being ignorant of the rules, or ignoring them, others make a special point of this to profess it.",,,,,,,,,,
"Jean-Marie","HEYLIGEN","(Belgium, 1961-)","Jean_Marie_HEYLIGEN.jpg","A painter, engraver and sculptor, Jean-Marie Heyligen first became interested in the female anatomy, which he eventually synthesised into floating forms in bold colours.  Unable to express himself through words, it is through plastic representation that he forges a link with others.  His inventive woodcarving is adorned with second-hand finds, which he recycles into knight's armour or Indian hair.  Jean-Marie Heyligen has been active in the arts workshop at the Centre André Livémont since 1981.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Brenda","HEYMANS","(Belgium, 1953-1991)","Brenda_HEYMANS.jpg","Through drawing, painting and collage, Brenda Heymans developed a personal mythology of enigmatic characters and signs.  It is thanks to her daughters that the Art et marges museum was able to enter her most secret garden, the world of embroidery, more than twenty years after she had passed away.",,,,,,,,,
"Josef","HOFER","(Germany, 1945-)","Josef_HOFER.jpg","Naked, frontal, tortured, locked up, assertive, these are the bodies that Josef Hofer offers us to see. The bodies? His body…? And do they offer them to us, these representations, or are they personal explorations? Do they link up with the outside world or do they participate in this retreating life imposed by the various handicaps the artist carries, including deafness and mutism? Josef Hofer started his graphic work at the age of 40, in creative workshops. A marked sexual character, framing that could be described as haphazard, and always the repetition of this frame made of yellow and red-orange lines ... Which corresponds to the frame of his mirror, placed at the foot of his bed, in his bedroom… Place to explore his body, in reflection, in parts."
"Jeroen","HOLLANDER","(Belgium, 1976-)","Jeroen_HOLLANDER.jpg","The channels of communication of Jeroen Hollander (Belgium, 1976) are public transport lines. He has been collecting plans and maps since his early childhood, and when he has to represent a city, he does so through the transport networks. More or less true to reality, his maps are pure inventions or inspired by cities actually visited. Because Jeroen travels only by train, tram and bus. His maps have undeniable plastic qualities which earned him the Young Belgian Painting Prize in 2009.",,,,,,,,,,
"David","HOUIS","(Belgium, 1989-)","David_HOUIS.jpg","David Houis’s drawings invite the viewer to become the protagonist of the image, thus turning the spectator firstly into the driver of a Formula 1 car, then the pilot of jet fighter, or even, finally, a gamer.  An extraordinary artist, with one energetic stroke, David Houis can interpret the perspectives and details of scenes in movement: motor racing, a plane landing or taking off and even scenes of war.  Every drawing is teeming with precise details realised meticulously, demonstrating his love and his patience."
,"JAKLINE","(Belgium, 1956-2023)","JAKLINE.jpg","Jakline does not speak readily about her work. (Jakline's work is not a deliberate act of self-expression) Her actions and artwork speak for her instead. She makes lace. One that stings, gets rusty and transmits tetanus. That is chiseled up by fullness and emptiness. Void as some devastated land, abandoned to the projection of our fears/anxieties. A sort of space, inside her iron and nickel cathedrals, where floats the echo of her revolt cried out in silence."
"Pol","JEAN","(France, 1952-Belgium, 2021)","POL_JEAN.jpg","It’s about shades that fade in the paper like lava, strokes that swarm and that are retained by a dark circle, as the lead maintains stained glasses together. It is a dense work created between a bedroom in the Queen Fabiola Center and the Campagn’art workshop (Neufvilles, Belgium), in a perpetual move where drawings and paintings are precious treasures to keep close to oneself, as much as the material used to produce them. It’s a singing, it is all the noise that cannot go out his mouth. It is all the music that his smile let imagine when he starts to put together architectures, portraits and fantasy animals that, under our look, circulate or melt. Dance."
"Solange","KNOPF","(Belgium, 1957-)","Solange_KNOPF.jpg","Solange Knopf was born in Brussels in 1957. Attracted to art for as long as she can remember, she put it on the back burner for a number of years, until it came to the fore as a way of coping with painful episodes in her life. At the end of the 90s, she studied at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Ixelles, but, driven by the need for resolutely personal expression, she soon withdrew from all artistic training. The Art et marges museum collection includes two drawings by Solange Knopf. Done in Indian ink on the pages of old books, they present faces in amniotic suspension, and it is unclear whether they are animal or human. A pre-existing stain seems to have guided these compositions, dated 2011. Since then, Solange Knopf has explored broader supports, and for a time entrusted her gesture to a more geometric construction, but her work always exudes a high degree of the spiritual and supernatural. Her work is like an invitation to the depths of being, strewn with faces, like spectres, in the shape of mysteries. Her work is represented by Cavin-Morris Gallery, New York."
"Karel","LAENEN","(Belgium, 1956-)","Karel_LAENEN.jpg","His works, with their shimmering colours and surreal titles, are hybrid compositions in which fragments of fauna, flora, humans and the cosmos are joyfully intertwined.  For many years now, he has been drawing continuously with joy and relish in the creative workshop of the psychiatric hospital in Geel (Kunsthuis Yellow Art), but also at home, with his foster family.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeannine","LEJEUNE","(Belgium, 1952-)","Jeannine_LEJEUNE.jpg","The aesthetics of Jeannine Lejeune's work can safely be described as being Baroque.  Her works are teeming with details, generous (in the image of their creator) and regularly borrow elements from the Catholic religion.  Each of her creations is an emanation of her inner world as well as being an invitation to explore our own inner world.  It is with this message that for long years she opened her house to visitors.  Actually, we should rather call it a museum!  Her house was a veritable work of art in itself.  Established on the heights of Huy, it was a denunciation of our throw-away society and transformed discarded materials into a festival of colour."
"Alexis","LIPPSTREU","(France, 1972-)","Lippstreu.jpg","Alexis Lippstreu lives in La Pommeraie (Hainaut, Belgium) and attends the creative workshop led by Bruno Gérard. His interest in drawing is complemented by an obsessive repetition of the themes chosen from Manet, Gauguin or Seurat. These masters do not attract him for a precise technique but rather for the imagery they have created. Raw, strong and speechless, they penetrate Alexis’ mind, who gives them a filtered, refined substance in which humans have an important role. The formal stereotype given to bodies is misleading to the distracted eye. Rich in diverse expressions, each schematic presence has their own life, which individualizes them in their false twinning. Centered on a few details, the graphics of Alexis are economical and give way to a great breathability of composition. There is a radiographic softness in his being as a designer."
"Francis","MARSHALL","(France, 1946-)","Francis_MARSHALL.jpg","Although he is an art teacher, Francis Marshall frequently finds his work exhibited alongside that of brut artists.  His works, which are both gritty and shrouded in mystery, break free from cultural norms; he creates what he feels he has never seen anywhere else.  Is he making a work in 3D?  He will call it "stuffing".  Is he working on a painting?  He will build it into a piece of furniture, so that it is not viewed as a painting.   And he will not be defined by being put into any box!",,,,,,,,,,
"Dirk","MARTENS","(Belgium, 1970-2022)","Dirk_MARTENS.jpg","Dirk Martens distorts photographic images cut out from books and magazines.  His constructions, in which the cut image and the handwritten word become entangled, are visually and conceptually multiple. 
In his collages – a technique that suits him perfectly – he transcends pure representation and visionary reading.  He sees his art as “flashes” during which reality and suffering disappear.  He often creates, as he puts it, totally “absurd and impracticable” machines to conjure his torments. He describes himself as someone socially inept and moreover attaches little importance to how others appreciate his work. His work reveals a troubling interior questioning put into perspective in a utopian socio-political framework.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Wolfgang","MARX","(Germany, 1946-2011)","Wolfgang_MARX.jpg","Wolfgang Marx glues, assembles and embroiders his work, which resembles a diary.  The richly decorated binders bring together childhood memories, feelings and impressions transcribed in red biro or Dymo, family photos, Christmas decorations... all generously adorned with sequins.
These objects become glittering baroque works of art, fashioned using thousands of nylon threads that protrude from the work.  The artist is very attached to his creations, keeping them with him and finding it hard to part with them permanently.  An intimate treasure chest, they are the intense reflection of his life.",,,,,,,,,,
"Ezekiel","MESSOU","(Benin, 1971-)","Ezekiel_MESSOU.jpg","Ezekiel Messou (Cotonou, Benin) repairs sewing machines in a town very close to Cotonou.  To draw up an inventory of the parts at his disposal, but also in order to remember how to disassemble and reassemble all the different models of machines, he draws the inventory on the walls of his workshop first, and then copies it in notebooks. Little by little, Ezekiel seems to join the drawing game, which leaves its purely utilitarian purpose and winds up bearing witness to his deep passion for these machines, whose contours he proceeds to draw generously. The drawings in the collection of Art et marges date from after 2013, the year he was discovered by the Outsider Art Collection. The interest shown in his drawings by three Europeans who came to his small workshop surprised Ezekiel Messou to no end. He went back to his creative work, which he had abandoned, full of enthusiasm, on plain paper and in ever freer forms too.",,,,,,,,,,
"Raphaël","MICHEL","(France, 1988-)","Raphael_MICHEL.jpg","On A4 paper, using a ballpoint pen, Raphaël discreetly compiles his daily life.  He faithfully retraces his journeys, the paths that he crosses, and the places that have marked him and given him pleasure.  A colourist, he uses marker pens, crayons and Tipp-Ex most frequently in order to saturate the surface of the support.  The rendering of his perspectives is audacious, nervous and very lively.  Very attached to the minutest detail, he faithfully reproduces everything meticulously: road signs, manhole covers, electric wiring, zebra crossings, even the reflection of a tree in the mirror above his washbasin.  On the back of his sheet of paper, he describes very exactly the situation he has experienced and illustrated on the other side.  This is his logbook: the intimate diary of his existence, punctuated with journeys, places and the moments of his life."
"Richard","MOSZKOWICZ","(Belgium, 1945-)","MOSZKOWICZ.jpg","Residing in a rest home very close to the Art et marges museum, Richard Moszkowicz takes the road several times a week to go to the plastic arts workshop at Créahm-Brussels. Although it started late (in 1997), it was with youthful freshness that the practice of painting came into his life. The energy that emanates from his compositions comes from lively tones but also from the writing work of an ""intimate journal"". Everyday facts have graphic value just as much as they contribute to self-development."
"Antoine","MVUMBI","(Belgium, 1974-)","AntoineMVUMBI.jpg","The works of Antoine Mvumbi are very colourful compositions realised essentially in oil pastels.  His first productions were distinguished by the juxtaposition of blocks of colour.  These works are very graphic, showing the audience fragments of architecture, giving the sensation of a split screen connected to surveillance cameras.  Gradually, his drawings started to feature images from magazines: Antoine Mvumbi appropriates all images and synthesizes them using his extraordinary faculty of observation and keen sense of composition."
"Michel","NEDJAR","(France, 1947-)","michelnedjar.jpg","Michel Nedjar, the man with dolls! He draws also, often in series, always by instinct, but the dolls undeniably constitute the trademark of his work. They are made of fabrics similar to those that Nedjar sold with his grandmother at the Clignancourt flee market.  These old fabrics, “Schmattess,” as his mother called them in Yiddish, are preferred by the artist over the fine fabrics of his father’s  tailor shop. The dolls are initially modelled on traditional dolls but are then gradually transformed into tortured, charred looking bodies. The artist thus exorcises the images he is obsessed with, namely the horror of the concentration camps, a horror that marked his family but which he discovered only in 1960 through the images of the film of Alain Resnais “Night and Fog.”  Later, the dolls become multicoloured. They are no longer transformed by dye or mud, but bear “scars” that go through a body stuffed with objects. You can easily imagine a teapot appearing here, a doll’s shoe there… they carry a story, that of their author, that of the erstwhile owners of fabrics or objects.  They are universal."
"Marion","OSTER","(Niger, 1960-)","marionoster.jpg","Marion Oster conveys an entire world of ritual magic steeped in her childhood in Africa and interests in non-European civilisations. Enchantment and wonder emerge from kitsch derision thanks to assembling talent. The sacred, which transcends and gives value, is distilled from the religious dimension. The detailed and patient work leads to creations of enormous freedom which brings us to the heart of reinvented folklore and traditions. Marion Oster puts her passion at the service of a collection that brings together a shared sensitivity, from outsider art to peculiar art via popular art. She has for that matter defended the work of these artists in two galleries which she kept fire in the belly (or “Le coeur au ventre”, the name of her second gallery) in Paris, then in Lyon."
"Aranka","PASZTOR-LIBAN","(Hungary 1920-Belgium 1999)","Aranka_PASZTOR-LIBAN.jpg","Like all young Hungarian girls of her generation, Aranka Pasztor-Liban learned embroidery in her childhood. It was thus quite natural that she chose this technique to reveal her idyllic personal universe.  When she was free of her domestic occupations when her two children had left home, creation became a vital element in her life. It was virtually viral as it invaded every corner of the house where she lived with her husband in Halanzy, in the province of Luxembourg. Flowers, blonde goddesses, butterflies... bathed in a bright, sparkling light delight the eye. Aranka Pasztor-Liban really lived her creativity, wearing the dresses that she made from shimmering fabrics."
"Marilena","PELOSI","(Brazil, 1957-)","Marilena_PELOSI.jpg","In Marilena Pelosi's drawings, women's bodies are at the centre of dark and frightening ritual scenes, as though they echo her own torments and her path through life that led her from Brazil to France, having fled a forced marriage with a voodoo priest.  She would have liked to enrol at the Beaux-Arts, but it is as an autodidact that she developed her artistic language.  She now considers that the absence of an apprenticeship has allowed her to find a truly personal graphic path."
"Rémy","PIERLOT","(Belgium, 1945-)","Remy_PIERLOT.jpg","A virtuoso of monotype, Rémy Pierlot reproduces images taken from films, imbuing them with a soft and mysterious atmosphere.  He is also known for his poetic landscapes, which speak volumes about the artist's sensitivity.  It is at La S Grand Atelier, in Vielsalm in the Ardennes, that the artist has been active since his retirement from the sheltered workshop where he worked as a labourer.",,,,,,,,,,
"Anne-Marie","POTVLIEGE","(Belgium, 1965-2017)","anne_mariepotvliege.jpg","Anne-Marie Potvliege showed an undisputed knack for handling colours very early on. She was initiated in interpretive drawing by the painter Luc Mondry, in the workshop of La Clairière and her work developed into a highly personal view of the subjects broached. Another aspect of her work is her series of tiles, probably due to the few months she spent in a mosaic studio. Locked in a repetitive system that she has wrought with rigour, her approach is devoid of monotony nonetheless. Her choice in the harmony of colours confers a pleasure that is renewed each time."
"André","PRUES","(Belgium, 1957-)","AndrePRUES.jpg","André Prues (Belgium, 1967) creates drawings which although made with a felt-tip pen bring to mind the dry point, and many maps beckon us to see landscapes that are conjured before our eyes rather than actually occur. The miracle of creation can be witnessed in André Prues, once the work became abstract. Before that, he created colourful and annotated works, and he talked a lot, even when drawing. Now, he is totally absorbed in this creation, but will gladly take a break to speak with you if you visit him at Campagn’art.",,,,,,,,,,
"Kenneth","RASMUSSEN","(Denmark, 1971-)","Kenneth_RASMUSSEN.jpg","Kenneth Rasmussen, a Dane from Denmark, knits giant jumpers and diverted, oversized objects that are part of his everyday life.  Since the age of 9, he has been interested in knitting, a girl's activity, as his peers reminded him.  His bedroom is lined with his creations, which he fills with objects that he has found.  He works at the Bifrost workshop in Randen, Denmark, which is also home to the GAIA museum of outsider art, where his work is exhibited.",,,,,,,,,,
"Christine","REMACLE","(Belgium, 1967-2014)","ChristineREMACLE.jpg","Christine Remacle draws heads with great majesty, which comes from her fascination for other people. She takes us into a world peopled with her friends or “husbands”, as she sometimes calls them. Her point of departure is not an existing model; they are people who come into her head, who inhabit her daily life and her imagination.
Eyes and mouths take shape as her hand works on the colour. The first step is to cover the paper with a kind of painted background, and on this base she uses a hand that is always expressive, sometimes violent and uncontrolled, sometimes precise and full of sensibility. Hand and colour come together to reflect her intense need to communicate through faces but also through landscapes that possess great serenity. She draws in La Hesse in Vielsalm.",,,,,,,,,,
"Fernanda","REYNS","(Belgium, 1957-)","FernandaREYNS.jpg","When you take a closer look at Fernanda Reyns' work, you see that behind the large figures lies a host of small characters.  There are hundreds of little circles where people, houses, children and trees are hiding, sometimes in front, sometimes behind, sometimes even inside.  Originally, they were distinct figures.  They have eyes, mouths, ears, hair and they wear jewellery.
Yet even if the meanings and contours are apparently lost, they still remain present.  Fernanda enthrals us with a drawing that brings together an alliance of contemporary and ancient cultures; a sobriety and an abundance that simultaneously create an impression of a crowd and isolation.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Pedro","RIBEIRO","(Portugal, 1990-)","PedroRIBEIRO.jpg","Pedro Ribeiro (Atelier Le Sésame, Brussels) produces his large characters that seem to stem from gestural painting at the Sésame centre, where he attends the painting workshop twice a week. The assistance of the workshop leaders can prove valuable to them in the choice of contrasted colours in particular, which enable Pedro to distinguish the different superposed traces in spite of an impaired sight. His painting work is characterized by a succession of layers, revealed in part by tears, a finishing touch he puts to his creations.",,,,,,,,,,
"Melina","RICCIO","(Italy, 1951-)","Melina_RICCIO.jpg","Melina Riccio’s work garnishes cities with messages of peace, love, ecology and justice, almost always written in rhyme.  The Art et marges museum maintains a collection of collages and textile compositions, but her multifaceted repertoire also includes poetry, graffiti and performances.  Struggling against a world ruled by money, Melina Riccio shares her critical vision through the sensitive experience of an anti-capitalist utopia.  It was following a period of overwork and burnout, accompanied by delirium, that she embarked on this creation, breaking suddenly with her former life as a stylist and a housewife."
"André","ROBILLARD ","(France, 1931-)","Robillard_10B.jpg","André Robillard is at times referred to as “the man with guns!” For thirty years, this creator who does not consider himself an artist, makes symbolic guns using tin cans, used light bulbs, old cogwheels, recovered pieces of wood, fabrics, nails, wire and scotch tape.  A multi-disciplinary artist he is also a musician:  percussion improvisations on rubbish bins using empty cartridges placed at the end of the fingers, accordion and harmonica accompanied by very personal songs. 
Present in the largest outsider art collections, this anti-conformist and anti-militarist artist beckons the viewers in a playful manner in spite of himself."
"Jean-Pierre","ROSTENNE","(Belgium, 1942-2017)","Jean_Pierre_ROSTENNE.jpg","Tout va bien sauf ce qui ne va pas was the motto of this atypical artist, a poetic thinker and key figure in a Brussels district that reflected his image: Les Marolles.  There, he ran an all-purpose bookshop on a corner of Rue Haute.  It is impossible to sum up his career with any certainty: he was a lieutenant in the Belgian army in the Congo in 1960; he spent time in Brazil, Rome, Paris and Switzerland; and for a number of years he had been making extraordinary walking sticks out of a variety of objects, which he used to stroll along the streets.  "In Africa, the cane is the link between heaven and earth.  In the Congo, it is an object of power.  This cosmological axis serves as a support for the motley assortment of everyday objects we'll be taking for a stroll...“",,,,,,,,,,
"Tomoaki","SAKAI","(Japan, 2001-)","Tomoaki_SAKAI.jpg","Tomoaki Sakai seems to have developed an inexplicable cult for household appliances.  From fridges to flat-screen TVs and washing machines, this young Japanese artist creates his small sculptures out of paper and tape with surgical precision.   He presents a world that opens up to our gaze.  In his world, a simple scribble represents a reflection, a piece of scotch tape, through skilful mastery, replaces the magnet, and where even the reproduction of the price of the appliance has its graphic importance.",,,,,,,,,,
"Nouzha","SERROUKH","(Morocco, 1968-)","Nouzha_SERROUKH.jpg","Nouzha Serroukh is equally at home working with paint, chalk or clay.  She is bewitched by a round universe: round mouths, round noses, round eyes, round hair, everything that is round, like the doves or the little balls of clay that she clumps together to create her universe in clay.  Nouzha Serroukh loves paint to be intense and luminous and she applies it thickly after completing her charcoal sketch.  In the Créahmbxl plastic arts studio, she gives birth to a gallery of characters and we do not know whether they are calling out to each other or if they are summoning us, the spectators, with their wide mouths."
"Anny","SERVAIS","(Belgium, 1952-2009)","AnnySERVAIS.jpg","Bulimic in her creativity, Anny Servais, known as "the baroness" or "the diva" occupied the central space of the Créahm studio in Liège.  She was there at a strategic point to appropriate all the available supports (not only paper, but also chairs, tables, drawers...).  She covered them with her gestural abstractions, sometimes embellished with photos fixed with a technique that she developed, using paint as glue."
"Daniel","STERCKX","(Belgium, 1965-)","Daniel_STERCKX.jpg","The artist’s gesture has been active in the plastic arts workshop of Créahm-Brussels since 1986 and  has brought into being eyes, mouths, nostrils… faces, and bodies – faces above all.  The body is outlined only roughly, the fixed gazes draw all the attention. Materials that are more superimposed than juxtaposed, as the horror, fright, surprise, sadness and disdain become clearer through the strength of the circular movement. The emotion conveyed by these characters drawn by a gesture that is more energetic than aggressive is perceived differently."
"Mohammed","TARGA","(Marocco, 1960-)","MohammedTARGA.jpg","During his six-year stay in the Nivelles prison, Mohammed Targa took part in the prison's painting workshops.  This activity enabled him to manage his time and cope better with the conditions of incarceration.  He created works of rare truth and expressivity that bear witness to a painful identity situation.  Painting offered him a concrete opportunity to abolish, transform and, above all, overcome the constraints imposed by society.",,,,,,,,,,
"Pascal","TASSINI","(Belgium, 1955-)","TASSINI.jpg","Pascal Tassini joined the Créahm Région Wallonne in 1986. After exploring different mediums, he finds his preferred mode of expression in textiles and more particularly in the knot. His hobby horse, you might say? Does this gesture remind him of the hours spent watching his sister-in-law knitting? If making a knot is probably the easiest way to hold two threads together, by multiplying them, Pascal Tassini, like a tightrope walker, creates on the line of balance. And on his own initiative, the first ""balls"" of fabrics, with precious packaging of furniture recovered or borrowed forever (tables, chairs, ladders), keychains of a fantasy wedding (dresses, floral bouquets, hats), encrypted love letters, or unexpected gifts, always the meticulous choice of materials. But also the concern for tensions and elevation."
"Dominique","THÉATE","(Belgium, 1958-)","DominiqueTHEATE.jpg","Dominique Théâte's visual universe is characterised by his instantly recognisable style, his obsession with wrestlers and his fantasy of the life of a golden boy.  An artist based at La S Grand Atelier in Vielsalm since the age of 33, Dominique Théâte's artistic aspirations go back much further than that, he was preparing to enter the Beaux-Arts in Liège before a serious motorbike accident affected his motor and brain functions.  He is a talkative character in life as much as in his work, and is the author of several joint publications with the artist Dominique Goblet: "Match de Catch à Vielsalm" and "Amour dominical" (published by Frémok).",,,,,,,,,,
"Jacques","TROVIC ","(France, 1948-2018)","Jacques_TROVIC.jpg","He learnt sewing and embroidering at a very young age from his mother and sister. He created his first tapestry in 1964, in the small miner’s house in a suburb of Valenciennes. He produces tapestries of monumental size on his kitchen table. The themes broached are inspired by the working class tradition, the mine, street scenes, feasts, carnivals, etc. Jacques Trovic embroiders a jute hessian base with fabrics bought on the Anzin market, wool in all colours, sequins, pearls, lace, and patchwork imbued with great poetry and great sensitivity."
"Pépé","VIGNES","(France, 1920-2007)","Pépé_VIGNES.jpg","So, ladies and gentlemen, my little children and the others, you see, we’re great drawers. For years we’ve been doing the job, so now we’ve started to make flowers, we’ve started to make boats, big boats, fish, then we started to make the weather, the time, then we started to make cellos, zithers, I made the avenue de la gare, I made the wall going to the church. We made trains with carriages, with signals, that’s what I did back then, and then I started making planes, aeroplanes (Pépé Vignes). Is the « job « mentioned by Pépé Vignes that of draughtsman? Or a cooper, which he practiced with his father? Or is he referring to his career as an accordionist and Saturday night ball singer? Pépé Vignes began drawing spontaneously, around the age of 40, covering exclusively the themes mentioned above. Extremely short-sighted, he drew with his face practically glued to the sheet of paper or cardboard."
"Pascale","VINCKE","(Belgium, 1974-)","Pascale_VINCKE.jpg","Pascale Vincke's drawings appeal to us from the very first glance.  So much tension and palpable emotions draw us into an introspective universe of abrupt curves and vivid colours, where intriguing portraits of women, this artist's favourite subject, come alive before our eyes. The initial models, photographs taken from fashion magazines revealing smooth and artificial beauties, are totally reclaimed, reinterpreted by the artist, becoming very real personal compositions.  She has been active at the Créahmbxl art studio from the age of 12 to 24 years of age."
"Jacqueline","VIZCAÏNO","(Algeria, 1937-)","Jacqueline_VIZCAINO.jpg","It was at the age of sixty that Jacqueline Vizcaïno discovered painting, which was to become a veritable revelation.  She painted on wood, using gouache that she then covered with wax polish, drawing her inspiration from Oriental and Hindu influences.  Over the years, her drawings have become more refined, filled with bright colours, revealing characters that are half-insect half-goblin, adorned with headdresses, Turkish slippers and wings, moving through a world of curves, flowers and multicoloured dots.",,,,,,,,,,
"Jean-Michel","WUILBEAUX","(France, 1968-)","Jean_Michel_WUILBEAUX.jpg","From 1990 to 2016, Jean-Michel Wuilbeaux produced a large number of oil paintings in his studio at La Pommeraie (Quevaucamps).  Keen to represent things as a whole, he uses a juxtaposition of perspectives that seem to unfold the image before our eyes.  His paintings are accompanied by texts displaying witty remarks.  But his works would not be complete if they did not contain their start and end dates, as well as the colour chart that went into their creation.",,,,,,,,,,
