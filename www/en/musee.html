                    <p>Located in the heart of Brussels, the Art et marges museum, museum of outsider art, questions art
                        and its borders.</p>

                    <p>The museum’s collection was created in the mid-1980s by self-taught artists, artistic workshops
                        for people with mental disabilities or in psychiatric settings. Nowadays it is composed of more
                        than 4000 international artworks produced outside the frequented trails of art.</p>

                    <p>The temporary exhibitions, at the rate of three a year, mix artists on both sides of the margin,
                        questioning the boundaries of art and its definition.</p>

                            containing texts, interviews, portraits of artists and reproductions of works.</p>

                        <p>Many exhibitions have since taken place, showing the works of self-taught artists some of
                            whom are residents in homes for the mentally disabled or patients in psychiatric hospitals,

                        <p>In order to reflect on our research Gérard Preszowe edited the magazine "Passages". The first
                            issue of the series entitled "Art en Marge Year 1" was written in collaboration with
                            Françoise Henrion, Chris Delville and Anne Vanderlinden.</p>

                        <p>During the exhibition “Women in Outsider Art”, the Viennese collector Hannah RIeger invites
                            us to live “in the Outsider Art” in her own way in this exhibition which brings together 105
                            works by Austrian and international artists, with the support of the Austrian Cultural Forum
                            in Brussels and the Austrian Federal Chancellery within the framework of the Austrian
                            Presidency of the Council of the European Union.</p>
                        <p> At the same time, the Art et marges museum pays tribute to the artist Jean-Pierre Rostenne,
                            in a room which brings together his totem canes, assemblages, photographs and diverted
                            objects as well as the publication of a book.</p>

                        <p>

                            Inspired by a quote from Henry Miller and a line from Alain Resnais, “America does not
                            exist, I know I have already been there” is a double exhibition / publication project
                            proposing to present “America” by raising the question of the place of the USA in the world,
                            more precisely through the collective imagination. Matthieu Morin, exhibition curator and
                            author of the publication, invites us to discover a hundred works of popular, contemporary
                            and outsider art from all over the world.</p>

                        brings together about two hundred works of outsider art from the collection, which includes a
                        total of more than 4000. It presents astounding creations designed by self-taught artists with a
                        unique mode of expression and great inventiveness, contextualized by those who made and still
                        shape the Art et marges museum to this day. Hear about the tale of the museum through a back and
